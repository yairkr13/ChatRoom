## Assumptions
- The site uses the Bootstrap CDN for styling, so an active internet connection is required for proper styling and icons to load.
- The backend uses Sequelize ORM connected to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL), ensure the database is set up and configured properly in the config files before running.

---

## Project Overview

- Users can register, login, and participate in a real-time chat interface.
